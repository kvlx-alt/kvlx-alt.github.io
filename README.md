# Playing with ChatGPT
---

Â¡Haha! I created or we created? This little search engine using ChatGPT. I made it for personal use, to search for keywords in my machine writeups from VulnHub and TryHackMe. You can find these writeups in [this repository](https://github.com/kvlx-alt/kvlx-alt.github.io/tree/main/MachineWriteups). They are simple so that I can understand them, but on [my LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kevinvanegaszubiria/recent-activity/articles/), you can find these complete writeups in article format, with images and well-organized for the general public. I did this in an afternoon of relaxation, and I will probably continue adding writeups and improving the site. Cheers!

## Additional Commands

You can use the following additional commands in this search engine:

- Typing `clear` clears the terminal screen.
- Typing `whoami` displays information about the creator of the website.
- Typing `ls` lists the files in the Articles folder.
- Typing `help` displays a help message with available commands.
